# two_step_algorithm
Code for two-step algorithm validation

The N3C codebook allows Python (Pyspark, Pandas), R, and SQL to operate datasets

Each file is a Python (Pyspark/Pandas) function, R function, or SQL function that can be called and generate related output tables

1)  LDS_all_patients_summary folder contains all the codes for the data cleaning and EDA

2)  Full measurement Two Step Algorithm folder contains all the codes for the TS validation of full measurement subset

3)  Imputed measurements Two Step algorithmfolder contains all the codes for the TS validation of imputed measurement subset
